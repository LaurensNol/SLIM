### Contribution
Since the goal of the project is to learn and get a grasp of how game engine development might work, there's currently no code contribution. If you have recommendations in any shape or form I'd be more than thankful if you open an issue with the 'recommendation' tag and give an explanation.

### Motivation
This project is immensely inspired by [The Cherno's Game Engine Series](https://thecherno.com/engine) on YouTube and [Jason Gregory's 'Game Engine Architecture'](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) book.
